# Accounting suite — remaining workstreams (after the Phases 3–5 / holes build)

Everything below is the **last** of the ACCOUNTING_SUITE_PLAN. As of this run, what's **done** (dark,
branch `feat/accounting-gl-phase1`, no migration applied, nothing deployed):

- **Phase 2 STAGE A–E** complete (AP, COGS, PO-receipt/GRNI, 3-way-match/PPV, GRNI recon, valuation store).
- **Hardening H1–H3** (dup-vendor-invoice, AP void/reversal, BilledQuantity FOR UPDATE lock).
- **Phase 3 complete incl. all §12 holes** — period close, year-end RE roll (+ statement interplay), indirect
  cash flow, bank reconciliation, fiscal-calendar read, cash-flow-classification attribute, close-transition
  audit columns, auto-reversing accruals at close, recurring journal templates, close-checklist gate +
  late-posting date resolver.
- **Phase 4a** — fixed-asset register + straight-line depreciation posting.
- **Phase 4b** — multi-currency posting (engine FxRate, backward-compatible) + period-end unrealized FX
  revaluation (realized-on-settlement still to do — see §1).
- **§7A conversion** — opening-balance journal (balance-sheet + AR/AP open items).
- **Cross-cutting §12** — reversal-of-reversal policy, dimension-required (Job/CostCenter), maker-checker
  large-JE threshold.
- **Phase 5 foundation** — pay-run + payroll journal posting (amounts provided).
- **forge-ui /accounting** — full read UI + interactive period-close and bank-reconciliation (branch
  `feat/accounting-gl-phase1` on forge-ui).

Full InMemory suite **1370 green**. The PG atomicity/concurrency tests still need a Docker box before
un-darking (sandbox has none).

---

## 1. Phase 4b — FX revaluation — **DONE** (commit `7a4b519d`), except realized-on-settlement

- **Multi-currency posting — done.** `PostingRequest.FxRate` (default 1); the engine computes
  `FunctionalAmount = round(TxnAmount × FxRate)`. At `FxRate == 1` it's **byte-for-byte** the old
  single-currency path (no rounding) — all 1370 prior tests stay green. One rate per entry, so the functional
  ledger balances whenever the transaction side does.
- **Period-end unrealized reval — done.** `FxRevaluationService.RevalueAsync(book, currency, newRate, asOf)`
  re-measures the **net foreign monetary position** (cash + AR/AP control in the foreign currency) and posts
  the functional carrying adjustment to `FX_REVALUATION` / `FX_GAIN`|`FX_LOSS` with `AutoReverseNextPeriod`
  (reuses the close auto-reversal). Functional-currency + no-rate-change are no-ops. `POST
  /accounting/fx-revaluation`, gated `CAP-ACCT-FXREVAL`. +5 tests.

**Remaining FX piece — realized FX on settlement.** When a foreign invoice/bill settles at a rate different
from its booking rate, the difference is a *realized* gain/loss. This needs **per-open-item booking-rate
tracking** (the AR/AP sub-ledger is currently a control-balance projection, not strict open items), then a
hook in the payment/settlement posting services: relieve AR/AP at the booked functional carrying value, take
cash at the settlement rate, and post the difference to `FX_GAIN`/`FX_LOSS`. Build alongside an open-item
sub-ledger load (it pairs naturally with §7A's open-item conversion). A future `CTA` line handles equity
translation for consolidations.

## 2. Cross-cutting §12 — JE attachments — **supported by existing infra**

`FileAttachment` is polymorphic and the generic `FilesController` already exposes
`POST /files/{entityType}/{entityId}/files` for any entity type — so a manual JE takes attachments today via
`EntityType = "JournalEntry"`. The UI/JE detail can surface it directly; no new backend. **Caveat:** the route
+ `FileAttachment.EntityId` are `int` while `JournalEntry.Id` is `long`; fine until a book exceeds ~2.1B
journal entries — widen to `long` (or key by entry number) before that's a concern.

## 3. Operational inventory ↔ perpetual valuation loop (Armory Plastics hold LIFTED 2026-06-07)

The hold is lifted; the perpetual loop is now wired end-to-end **except job-complete→FG**:

- **Receipt → raw stock — DONE** (`7f96297c`). PO receive stocks a `BinContent` (find-or-create + default
  receiving bin); feeds the valuation store at landed cost (already in STAGE C). Operational (not gated).
- **Ship → relief — DONE** (`36a52553`). `ShipShipment` relieves on-hand via `InventoryReliefService`
  (FIFO bin decrement + Ship movement, idempotent, backorder-tolerant). Also standardized
  `BinContent.EntityType` on canonical lowercase `"part"` — **fixed a latent `MrpService` on-hand bug**
  (it filtered capital `"Part"`, so MRP saw zero on-hand for every part).
- **Material issue → WIP — DONE** (`46b7e701`). New `MaterialIssuePostingService` (FULLGL-gated, inline):
  Issue → Dr WIP / Cr INVENTORY_{class}; Scrap → Dr OPERATING_EXPENSE / Cr …; Return → reverse + re-credit
  store. Relieves the valuation store at weighted-average via `ApplyIssueAsync` (falls back to the issue's
  unit cost when no store row); idempotency pre-check guards the store side-effect.
- **Sale → COGS — REFINED** (`46b7e701`). `InvoiceArPostingService` COGS relief now sources cost from the
  valuation store (weighted-average, decrementing in lock-step) when the FG part is carried there, falling
  back to standard cost otherwise — closes the §12 STAGE-E TODO. Same idempotency pre-check added.

- **Job-complete → FG — DONE.** New explicit **receive-to-stock** step (`POST
  /jobs/{id}/production-runs/{runId}/receive-to-stock`, gated `CAP-MFG-COMPLETE`) —
  `ReceiveProductionRunToStock` stocks the run's good output into an FG bin and stamps `ReceivedToStockAt` /
  `ReceivedQuantity` (idempotent: a second call no-ops). New `ProductionReceiptPostingService` (FULLGL-gated,
  inline) posts Dr INVENTORY_FG / Cr INVENTORY_WIP at **standard cost** + feeds the FG valuation store. The
  three open questions were resolved per owner: good qty = `CompletedQuantity` (the validator's disjoint
  reading is canonical; the yield formula is the buggy one — left for a separate reporting fix); **standard
  cost** valuation (WIP residual = production variance, recognized at period-end — symmetric with the receipt
  service deferring PPV); an **explicit receive step** (not auto-on-Completed), so `UpdateProductionRun` is
  untouched. Additive migration `AddProductionRunReceivedToStock` (NOT applied). +10 tests. The perpetual loop
  is now closed end-to-end: **receipt → raw → WIP → FG → COGS.**

  **Follow-ups since:**
  - **Subassembly-inventory key — DONE.** New seeded account `13250 Inventory — Subassemblies` / key
    `INVENTORY_SUBASSEMBLY`; receipt, material-issue, and production-receipt services all route the Subassembly
    class to it (previously a `Dr WIP / Cr WIP` wash). Reconciles by part via the valuation store like any
    stocked class.
  - **`ReceivedQuantity`/`ReceivedToStockAt` on the run read model — DONE** (API). UI surfacing still pending.
  - **Yield / OEE reporting bug — FIXED.** First-pass yield is now `good / (good + scrap)` (canonical
    `ProductionRun.YieldPercent`), and `OeeService` Quality/Performance now treat `CompletedQuantity` as the
    GOOD count (total processed = good + scrap + rework) — both previously used the wrong
    `(Completed − Scrap)/Completed` / `CompletedQuantity-as-total` reading. The `ReworkQuantity`→good
    relationship and a dedicated rework metric are a separate reporting refinement.

  **Still deferred — production variance (entangled with WIP absorption).** Receiving FG at standard credits
  INVENTORY_WIP by `standard × qty`. But **only material currently posts to GL WIP** (the material-issue
  service); labor/overhead are tracked operationally (`IJobCostService`) and are **not** absorbed into the GL
  WIP account. So crediting WIP at the FULL standard FG cost (material + labor + overhead) over-relieves WIP by
  the labor/overhead portion and can drive INVENTORY_WIP negative. Doing variance "right" therefore needs, in
  order: (1) **labor/overhead absorption postings** into WIP (Dr WIP / Cr applied-labor|overhead) as production
  happens; (2) a **WIP→run allocation** rule (a job's WIP split across its runs / partial completions); then
  (3) the explicit **production-variance** posting of the standard-vs-actual residual (a
  `MATERIAL_USAGE_VARIANCE`-style account already exists in the seed). This is a Phase-5/6 costing workstream,
  not a quick refinement — until it lands, the standard-cost WIP residual simply remains in INVENTORY_WIP.

## 4. Pre-go-live (independent of new features)

- Run the deferred **Postgres atomicity + concurrency tests** on a Docker-enabled box (the `…AtomicityTests`
  and the 3-way-match FOR UPDATE race) before flipping `CAP-ACCT-FULLGL` on.
- Seed the new capability codes into the catalog: `CAP-ACCT-DEPRECIATION`, `CAP-PAYROLL-RUN`,
  `CAP-ACCT-MULTICURRENCY`, `CAP-ACCT-FXREVAL` (and ratify the deferred `CAP-P2P-BILL`/`CAP-P2P-PAY`).
- Maker-checker is the synchronous first cut (approver supplied at post time, must differ from poster); a full
  async pending-approval workflow is the follow-up.
